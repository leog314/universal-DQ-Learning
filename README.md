# universal-DQ-Learning
=======
**Requirements:** 
    Python (<=3.11)
    
to install all needed libraries run:

    pip install torch torchvision gymnasium matplotlib numpy
    
  Also you'll need some gymnasium-environments to test the algorithm on, for example the Box2d-env (https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/).
  Because of this, you probably need to install additional packages like (for Box2d):
  
    pip install swig
    pip install "gymnasium[box2d]"

  Needed packages are listed at the specific websites of the environments (see also: https://gymnasium.farama.org/)

Notice that the installation of the packages may be different on Windows. It was so far only tested on Linux Mint.
